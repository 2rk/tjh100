%h2 Triplej Hottest 100 Tipping Comp
.intro
  What started as a bit of fun each year between a couple of friends with *cough* an excel spreadsheet *cough*, is now online!
  So, you register below and pick 40 songs that you think will poll the best on the day, not necessarily 'your' favourites.
  %b Scoring
  The scoring is 1 point if a song pick comes in at position 100, through to 100 points for the number 1 song.
  You also select one of your 40 picks to be the song that you think will be number 1.  The pick that scores the highest gets 50
  additional points.  Should there be more than one person who picks the same song, all will get 50 points
